I am interested in the development, evaluation, and application of phylogenetic methods, using Bayesian statistics as an overarching framework and fossil as well as extant vertebrates as my primary model system. My current research projects include the development of a fast and flexible Bayesian method for estimating time-scaled supertrees, and an empirical study assessing the ability of environment-dependent birth-death models to yield insights into the diversification of coevolving clades.

In 2018, I started my PhD in Geophysical Sciences at the [University of Chicago](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/david-cerny/), where I joined the [Slater Lab](https://fourdimensionalbiology.com) to work on fossil vertebrate phylogenetics and macroevolution. My previous research experience includes paleontological and ecological fieldwork in Poland and French Polynesia, a bioinformatics internship in the [Kondrashov Lab](https://annualreport2017.crg.eu/scientific-report/bioinformatics-and-genomics/evolutionary-genomics/) at the Centre de Regulació Genòmica in Barcelona, Spain, and undergraduate research in the [Alfaro Lab](https://michaelalfaro.github.io/alfaro-lab/team/) at UCLA.
