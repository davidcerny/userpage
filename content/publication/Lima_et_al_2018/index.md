  Phylogenetic relationships amongst the robust capuchin monkeys (genus *Sapajus*) are poorly understood. Morphology-based taxonomies have recognized anywhere from one to twelve different species. The current IUCN (2017) classification lists eight robust capuchins: *S. xanthosternos*, *S. nigritus*, *S. robustus*, *S. flavius*, *S. libidinosus*, *S. cay*, *S. apella* and *S. macrocephalus*. Here, we assembled the first phylogenomic data set for *Sapajus* using ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) to reconstruct a capuchin phylogeny. All phylogenomic analyses strongly supported a deep divergence of *Sapajus* and *Cebus* clades within the capuchin monkeys, and provided support for *Sapajus nigritus*, *S. robustus* and *S. xanthosternos* as distinct species. However, the UCE phylogeny lumped the putative species *S. cay*, *S. libidinosus*, *S. apella*, *S. macrocephalus*, and *S. flavius* together as a single widespread lineage. A SNP phylogeny constructed from the UCE data was better resolved and recovered *S. flavius* and *S. libidinosus* as sister species; however, *S. apella*, *S. macrocephalus*, and *S. cay* individuals were recovered in two geographic clades, from northeastern and southwestern Amazon, rather than clustering by currently defined morphospecies. STRUCTURE analysis of population clustering revealed widespread admixture among *Sapajus* populations within the Amazon and even into the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest. Difficulty in assigning species by morphology may be a result of widespread population admixture facilitated through frequent movement across major rivers and even ecosystems by robust capuchin monkeys.
